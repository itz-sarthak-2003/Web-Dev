I am working on a GUI layout for your midterm program, which involves creating a frame with various elements like a header, left-side and right-side boxes, an image tag, and an unordered list (UL). Here's a brief description of what your code needs to accomplish, followed by a possible implementation using HTML and CSS if you're working with web development, or Java Swing if it's a desktop application.

Brief Description:
The task requires creating a user interface that contains:

Header: A section at the top of the frame, typically used for the title or navigation elements.
Left-side box: A box on the left side of the frame, which could be used to hold navigation links or other menu options.
Right-side box: A box on the right side of the frame, often used for sidebars, additional information, or images.
Image tag: An image displayed within the frame, perhaps in one of the boxes.
UL list: An unordered list, likely containing some informational or navigational items.
